## Git Best Practices

Branches should be made on a per-feature basis. That can be one file, or one
function on a file, what constitutes a feature is the kind of thing that is hard
to define, but you know it when you see it. If working on the same file as
someone else at the same time as they are working on it, everyone may not see a
feature the same, so make sure you both agree on what constitutes the features
you are both working on, try not to be working on the same part of the same file
with another person. As long as you work on different parts of the file, you
should be able to work on a file with another person without merge conflicts.
